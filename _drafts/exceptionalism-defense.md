# American Exceptionalism is Underrated

It's a simple fact that the United States of America is the oldest surviving
democracy in the world. For this simple fact we have to thank the coming
together of this country's founders at the Constitutional Convention, a
gathering of people educated in the recent philosophical and economic
breakthroughs of the British and French Enlightenment. The result was a
Constitution more about system than policy, and that system was designed to
work with highly imperfect humans operating it by using our self-motivated
interests to limit the amount of power any one person or faction could weild.
It limited the official power of the church to unprecedented degrees and gave
ordinary individuals unprecedented rights. The system has proved free enough
and flexible enough to persist and flourish despite unprecendented technological
and cultural change. This beginning helped make the United States exceptional.

But our founding is not all that makes us exceptional. At the end of the 19th
and the beginning of the 20th century the New World experienced a wave of mass
immigration. Italians, Irish, Germans, and a variety of eastern Europeans
came to the East Coast, while Chinese and Japanese arrived in the West. Because
of the difficulty and expense involved in crossing the ocean, the US received
the best, the most motivated, and the most desperate of people from many parts
of the world. The economic boom and melting pot culture that emerged helped
make the US a world leader in innovation throughout much of the 20th century.

Today we've had another round of mass immigration, one that began over 30 years
ago. The world sends their best and brightest to American universities. As a
result we continue to push the scientific and technological boundaries. Some of
those students stay and continue to make America great, but many others return
to their homeland, often bringing with them bits of American culture. Of course
this isn't the only way we export our culture around the globe, but it's a
subtle one, and perhaps as important as Hollywood films, popular music, and the
many internationally popular internet sites that originate in the United States.

We are the world's only uncontested global hegemon, the first and only one in
history. We are the only state capable of projecting conventional military
power anywhere in the world. Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and much of NATO all
rely to some degree on American military power to guarantee their security from
aggressors while themselves maintaining historically weak militaries. We provide
maritime security across the globe. We play a leading political and economic
role throughout the world.

Of course much of our national heritage is not always so glorious. A
disproportionate share of what makes our universities leaders in research and
education came from Jews fleeing Nazism in Europe, a tragedy we did pitifully
little to reduce. Our nation was conceived in freedom, except for its mass of
black slaves. Chattel slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration. White
racism, especially against blacks, is an atrocity that we might never
sufficiently address. Cold war politics had us using our economic and military
might supporting dictators committing genocide, and in the last decade we've
waged wars we had no chance of winning, only to leave a region in chaos from
which new brands of global terrorism have sprouted.

But because of our place as the world's sole global hegemon and the leading
nation at the scientific and technological frontier, it's utterly crucial we
remind ourselves of our exceptional nation. American Exceptionalism is a crucial
part of the American psyche, and we need it to push us to continue to lead, to
continue to innovate.

Yes, we've made some misteps in the way we've asserted our global power, at
great cost to people throughout the world. But we helped steward one of the
economic miracles of the 20th century by governing Japan reasonably well in
the aftermath of their surrender. Our intervention in the Korean War made
another possible, and our alliance with Taiwan a third. We managed to help
protect Bosnians from what may well have become another genocide in the 1990s.
We've done a great deal more good than harm.

But more importantly, the world is likely to become a worse place if we retreat
from the world stage. Russia is bullying its neighbors, and the EU is too weak
and dependent on Russian oil to stop it. China today is acting more agressive
with it's neighbors around the Nine-Dash Line in the South China Sea and in
the Doklam region of the Himalayas, and our allies in this region will be much
stronger with a strong United States backing them.

I live in San Francisco, a truly exceptional part of the United States. I was
fortunate enough to get an education at the University of Chicago, a place full
of people with immense talent, intelligence, and ambition. Yet I felt completely
overwhelmed by the talent and ambition I was surrounded by when I moved to SF.
I find myself meeting people making groundbreaking contributions to type theory
and machine learning. I meet people who are scraping all the internet and giving
the data to the public for free. People who think they'll be able to make brain
cancer cells revert to healthy brain cells, or who think they might actually
defeat aging and leave us all capable of running marathons when we're 200 years
old. Some want to create floating cities on the sea, or make it possible for
someone anywhere in the world to start a new business in days rather than
months. Some expect a day will come when we create an intelligence of God-like
power, and truly believe that their work today might help increase the chance
if it being a benevolent God.

Some of these projects may seem frivolous and quirky. Some will surely fail. But
I don't know which will prove frivolous and which essential, and truly nobody
does. But if that doesn't convince you that San Francisco and the Bay Area is
truly exceptional and important, remember that pioneering LGTBQ movements
started here. The Bay Area is an innovation engine for social justice movements
as well as technologies. It's an exceptional environment, one that bears a
larger burden in the project of making the world a better place.

This Bay Area Exceptionalism is just one flavor of American Exceptionalism. We
live in an exceptional environment, socially, geographically, economically, and
politically. This exceptional environment places a burden on us, to continue to
promote peace and security, and to push the boundaries of human knowledge and
capabilities yet further.
